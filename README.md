# Dijkstra
Dijkstra algorithm in Java

This is an implementation of [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)  I've written for use in personal projects. It is available under the MIT license so feel free to do whatever you'd like with it.

DISCLAIMER:
I haven't thorougly tested this implementation, so bugs may be present. Beware of this.
